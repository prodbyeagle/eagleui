## Installation

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or Yarn) installed.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Using npm**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   npm install @prodbyeagle/eagle-ui
   ```

2. **Using Yarn**

   If you prefer Yarn, run:

   ```bash
   yarn add @prodbyeagle/eagle-ui
   ```

3. **Verify Peer Dependencies**

   Some components might rely on additional peer dependencies. Make sure to check the [documentation](#) or package details for any extra requirements.

## Usage

Integrate EagleUI components into your Next.js project by importing them into your pages or components. Below is a simple example:

```tsx
// pages/index.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@prodbyeagle/eagle-ui';

const Home: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '2rem', textAlign: 'center' }}>
      <h1>Welcome to EagleUI</h1>
      <p>Customize and build fast with our reusable components!</p>
      <Button variant={border} onClick={() => alert('Button Clicked!')}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

This example demonstrates how to import a `Button` component and integrate it into your Next.js page with some basic inline styling.
